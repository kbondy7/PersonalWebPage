        <p class= "text1"> My name is Kieran Bondy and I am a 20 year old Computer Science student at Northwestern University. My love for Computer Science began in high school when my brother and I started developing games for IOS in our free time. Since then I have continued to develop for IOS and more as I learned new things. The limitless ability for creation was what drew me to Computer Science and this passion has fueled my exploration up to this point.</p>

        <p class= "text1"> Outside of Computer Science I perform long form improv for a Northwestern club called The Titanic Players. We have a show on the first of every month and it is a great outlet. Long form improv focuses on relationships and teamwork to create meaningful scenes. From when I started doing improv in high school I have grown a lot as a teammate and an individual.</p>
