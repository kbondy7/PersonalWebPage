        <p class= "text1"> My name is Kieran Bondy and I am a 20 year old computer science student at Northwestern University. I was introduced to computer science during highschool when my brother and I began developing IOS games. I started taking classes school and fell in love with the subject. The freedom in problem solving allowed me to be creative in a way that no other subject had before. Since then I have pursued this passion in and out of school developing applications in my free time as I continue to grow as a developer.</p>

        <p class= "text1"> Outside of computer science I perform long form improv for a Northwestern club called The Titanic Players. We have a show on the first of every month and it is a great outlet. Long form improv focuses on relationships and teamwork to create meaningful scenes. From when I started doing improv in high school I have grown a lot as a teammate and an individual.</p>

        <p class= "text1"> I am also involved in other communities on campus. I play various sports at school including soccer, football, and floor hockey. I am the treasurer of Northwestern’s IEEE club which focuses on creating a community in the Computer Science department at Northwestern. On top of that prepares students for the job market by introducing them to important aspects of a development team through project work. I also have worked as a Teacher’s Assistant at Northwestern for EECS 211 an introductory computer science course. This not only furthered my grasp of the material in the course, but also improved my ability to articulate my ideas to those who are still learning the subject.</p>
