        <p class= "text1"> I joined the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers during my sophomore year. I learned a lot during my first two quarters in the club working in a small team to build a React Native Application for the IEEE Showcase. The Showcase was an amazing experience to present our ideas and work to industry professionals and was all organized by IEEE. During the Spring I became the Treasurer and helped plan events such as a Hackathon and the EECS Department Barbeque. This position and club has provided me with many skills that I think will be beneficial in a working environment.</p>

        <p class= "text1"> This summer I worked at Trumid, a Financial Start up with the goal of creating an open trading platform for bonds. This was my first experience in a real Computer Science focused job and I learned a lot during my time there. I had many different jobs while interning there ranging from upgrading code to python 3 to building pixel trackers for the companies daily emails. The most important lessons were learned by simply being in a development environment. I realized how important planning and communication is when managing such a large scale project that depends on many different components and people.</p>
